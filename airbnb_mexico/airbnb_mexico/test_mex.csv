The room--we stayed in the Mexican suite--was such a gem, clean and well-kept. It had all the amenities we needed, from TP to Towels, pots and pans to olive oil and coffee. Cathy brought us up fresh baked, warm cookies (we thought would last a week but lasted two days because they were so delicious). The porch off the room had a view of the water, and you could even see it while showering. The upper roof deck had plenty of seating, room and views of the beach and ocean, with amazing sunsets. We had our dog and 1.5 year old child, and both were safe and happy. There are walkable bars and decent food, with Poco Cielo being one of the places we enjoyed eating at many times. Cathy was always available for questions and had really good answers. She is a great host and worth staying with. The rooms are quiet, clean, and well priced.
Cathy's Mexican suite was our Mexican dream, from the word go she made us feel very welcomed with complementary cheese platter and freshly baked cookies which is just what we needed. Her suites are all decked out with all you need. Relaxing view points from out our balcony the bbq area and landing before the beach which was our favourite watching Mexican sunsets. Cathy is very knowledgeable about the area made us feel safe and pointed us in the detection of the Baja wine country where we had a blast tasting the regions best wines. Nothing was to much trouble. Her pet dogs are sweet and so well trained, and her garden I'm envious off :) thanks for our wonderful stay
Cathy is a gracious and kind host.
This is a gem! Cathy is incredibly kind and made us feel so welcome right from the first moments we arrived. To open our door and find cookies still warm from the oven was our first hint that this was a very special place. Our suite was beautiful and with every convenience we could have wanted. Add to that a private ocean view and the most comfortable bed, and we have a recipe for a perfect relaxing getaway. Cathy went over the top to accommodate us, even providing excellent driving instructions there and back again. We can't wait to go back and bring our dog with us!
Not only was this place beautiful, cozy, and full of amenities, it possibly the most relaxed I have ever been in my life. Cathy was a wealth of information from making sure we had good directions. to the best places to eat, and all importantly, when was the best time of day to re-cross the border (it takes a long time). We were welcomed with a beautiful clean condo, fresh baked cookies and the smell of the ocean. The beach is nearly private and so peaceful. My husband and I stayed here for three nights and only left because we're average people who have to get back to work at some point. :) I would recommend this spot to anyone: couples, families. etc. We're hoping to come back with our friends and rent out all three units in the future.
Don't know how our stay could have been any better. We were greeted warmly by Cathy who is as cheery as she looks in her picture. The online photos of the apartment - as great as they are - don't do it justice. Every corner reflects Cathy's artistic touch, creating an wonderfully embracing space. The complementary cheese plate didn't hurt our first impression, either. It took us all of 10 seconds to wish we had time for a longer stay. We slept well, used both balconies, and our dog loved the beach as much as we did.
Our host Cathy was amazing! Even before we arrived, her communication was superb. She sent us a detailed list of things to do and special places to go. She got the Mexican car insurance for me, so I didn't have to worry about a thing!! We arrived early, so our room wasn't quite ready. She immediately came out to greet us and suggested a wonderful local restaurant for lunch, Poco Cielo, that we could walk to. Oscar, our waiter, was exceptional along with the food. When we came back to check in, Cathy had made homemade chocolate chip cookies and had a delicious plate of cheeses and grapes for us waiting in our room. Cathy upgraded us to the Asian suite which was beautiful. Living space, full kitchen, amazing wood ceiling bedroom and the best part was we had access to the upstairs deck to enjoy the gorgeous views of the ocean. We ventured up the coast to the small fishing village of Popotla, where we bought a fresh fish right off the boat. We had it filleted for us and brought it home to cook on the grill that was on the upstairs deck!! The area was quiet and peaceful. The sounds of the waves crashing during the night lulled us to sleep. We can't wait to return to Cathy's oasis!!!

The condo was just as advertised, lovely and new, and just a short walk to the beach. The private patio/balcony was great. Medano Beach is beautiful and welcoming. Highly recommended and we plan to return soon.
This was a great first experience with Airbnb. The condo was exactly as pictured and very nice. Kirsten was very helpful throughout the whole booking and planning of our trip. We loved visiting Cabo and will absolutely visit again. The only problem with the condo I can say was the drain to the jacuzzi tub in the master suite was broken so we were unable to use it the first 3 days of our stay, but we contacted the Property Managers per Kirsten and they got back to us right away and set up a time to come fix it. All in all, it was an amazing place to stay and very close to all the fun and relaxation you could want in Cabo.
We had a great stay. It's a great location. We enjoyed the pool; very modern. It was a nice walk to the beach. We will return!
Kirsten is amazingly fast at responding to questions and provides a detailed guest packet that has everything you need. The local property manager is equally as quick to respond and the onsite guards are warm, welcoming, and helpful. She also partners with a car service that we used for our round trip airport transportation, and they were also very friendly and responsive. The property is beautiful, well maintained, and is in a great location. A block from the beach and 1-2 blocks from hotels that have small delis where you can pick up some necessities, use the ATM, and dine at the restaurants. There is also a spa within blocks of the condo where you can get massage, mani, pedi. $10 USD cab ride into downtown (everyone prefers US dollars but if you use the ATM you can only get pesos). You'll get better value if you use pesos. Almost all the cab drivers knew the name of the condo but we had the address and the name of the hotel that is 1 block away stored in our phones so we didn't have really have any issues. The guest book in the condo has great recommendations for restaurants and activities. My trip was a graduation present for my god-daughter and this property was perfect. We each had our own bedroom and bathroom and it was so great having a kitchen and laundry, free wi-fi, Netflix, and pool - all for much less than the hotels I was looking at booking. I highly recommend this property to anyone!
My first time using Airbnb. Great experience! Kristen was very ressponsive. Condo was clean and as described. Short walk to the beach. Would recommend this place to anyone!

Almost all the cab drivers knew the name of the condo but we had the address and the name of the hotel that is 1 block away stored in our phones so we didn't have really have any issues. The guest book in the condo has great recommendations for restaurants and activities. My trip was a graduation present for my god-daughter and this property was perfect. We each had our own bedroom and bathroom and it was so great having a kitchen and laundry, free wi-fi, Netflix, and pool - all for much less than the hotels I was looking at booking. I highly recommend this property to anyone!

The process was incredibly easy, the view was gorgeous, and the apartment was clean. Definitely a place worth staying!
Loved our stay at Kas's condo! The setting is perfect and all of the other people there were extremely helpful. We would be very happy to stay there again. The only caution we would give, is to be prepared for ""spotty"" internet serrvice : ) Kas was also very flexible with our check out time to coordinate with our flight.
Unfortunately, I was unable to make it down to Puerta Vallarta due to the hurricane. Kas was very understanding and professional, and gave me a full refund on the price of the room. Based on his refreshing show of good character alone I would recommend him to anybody looking to spend some time in Puerta Vallarta.
El anfitrión contestó mis preguntas muy rápidamente y amablemente. Una vez aceptada la invitación, la persona local contestó de manera clara y rápida todas mis preguntas referentes al lugar. El lugar cuenta con suficiente estacionamiento, las instalaciones generales funcionan correctamente, las personas de recepción nos atendieron muy bien. La habitación tiene una vista preciosa a la bahía de Vallarta y a la playa. Todo estaba muy limpio, había toallas para la alberca y playa, el lugar estaba muy cómodo e incluso pudimos haber cocinado ahí. El restaurante está rico y las bebidas muy buenas... sobre todo la hora feliz de 6pm a 7pm. Se puede ingresar a ambas playas sencillamente. Las playas están hermosas y muy limpias porque no son tan conocidas por el turismo. Hay regaderas para limpiarse la arena y el personal de servicio es muy amable. Lo recomiendo ampliamente para un fin de semana íntima y disfrutar simplemente del mar y la playa.
Excelente todo, tal cual venía en la descripción, tiene todo lo necesario para estar comodo; nos encantó. :)
This condo was beyond excellent. I came out for a beautiful relaxing vacation, and recieved just that. It was very cozy with a fantastic view! In all of my travels, this is probably the best beach I've ever been to. Everyone at the complex was lovely and helpful, the staff was very friendly. Overall our stay was a breeze, Kas was very helpful and informative. I highly recommend this place, and would love to come back myself!
We arrived late, around 10pm. We were told there was 24/7 access which accurate -- though a complete ghost town which made my fiance and i a little worried. Unfortunately we arrived without much in amenities and the front desk person told us there was nowhere nearby to even grab a beer, he was pleasant and spoke English. I had low expectations coming in, but the building on a whole felt like it had seen better days. With that, It was a perfectly sunny day in the morning and didn't see anyone out, the ghost town continues... This is a large condo complex, and i saw one young boy wandering the halls with a mobile device. Before we checked out an elderly couple in the lobby. The room itself was clean, particularly the bathroom which was good, and everything was as described. The listing said you could push the beds together, which we didn't even bother since it would of required a lot of work / including re-routing a power strip that was mounted to the wall ( too tired to bother). My fiance and I ended up sleeping in separate beds as the place didn't have any sense of being ""romantic"", though it did have charm with the mexcan headboards. The A/C worked which was a godsend. It would not take a lot of work to touch this place up a bit but it wasn't somewhere I'd likely return - there are other places nearby that are same price that are in better upkeep. Dock 1 point for feeling outdated and 1 for ghost town/amenities. I believe the glowing nature of the rest of the reviews, just thinking we might of been a little offseason in early October. I definitely recommend some fresh paint and a deep clean of the place to give this place a bit more pop.

The views are incredible and the pool is amazing. We also enjoyed the common terrace, from which you can see the beautiful stars. Having A/C in the room as well as a fan proved quite useful. We spent a couple of hours in the hot afternoon just reading overlooking the view and loved it. Lino and Bonifacio were great, particularly Bonifacio. My only negative comment is that the place was not spotless clean, it could use a little extra cleaning. Other than that, it was great. Please keep in mind that you do need a car. I can't imagine how difficult it would have been to get around without one. Plus, Zipolite beach is definitely worth a visit.
This is my second time, Edgar per usual sent a welcome packet and communicated via email. We were greeted by the groundsman, who remembered us from last time, cool guy. Had a great time! Planning to go back again. The area is quiet tranquil and the views are exceptional. I suggest you rent a good car as the terrain leading up to the house (roadway) is rocky and mostly dirt road but manageable.
Though Edgar wasn't there, his staff were very helpful and Edgar was always available if we had questions/concerns. The space itself is absolutely beautiful and the views are spectacular. It's definitely a place where you can simply relax and be. Highly recommend it!
Edgar's Apartments is beautiful. The lofts directly overlook the Pacific Ocean. Edgar's guide to the loft contains all the necessary information including how to get there, restaurant recommendations, nearby activities, etc. Thank you Ed for being a great host! We'll be back soon. Thanks, Daniel
Edgar is thorough he sent a long and accurate guide with all sorts of information on the property and surround. The place is breathtaking the view is amazing and the people that work there were very nice and helpful. I defintely plan on staying there again.
My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience at the loft. The view, pool, and ambiance were amazinh. We took an amazing tour with the company next door as well. Lino and bonafacio made our stay very easy. This is the perfect place along the coast to relax in a beautiful space!

This is my second time, Edgar per usual sent a welcome packet and communicated via email. We were greeted by the groundsman, who remembered us from last time, cool guy. Had a great time! Planning to go back again. The area is quiet tranquil and the views are exceptional. I suggest you rent a good car as the terrain leading up to the house (roadway) is rocky and mostly dirt road but manageable.
Though Edgar wasn't there, his staff were very helpful and Edgar was always available if we had questions/concerns. The space itself is absolutely beautiful and the views are spectacular. It's definitely a place where you can simply relax and be. Highly recommend it!
Edgar's Apartments is beautiful. The lofts directly overlook the Pacific Ocean. Edgar's guide to the loft contains all the necessary information including how to get there, restaurant recommendations, nearby activities, etc. Thank you Ed for being a great host! We'll be back soon. Thanks, Daniel
Edgar is thorough he sent a long and accurate guide with all sorts of information on the property and surround. The place is breathtaking the view is amazing and the people that work there were very nice and helpful. I defintely plan on staying there again.
My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience at the loft. The view, pool, and ambiance were amazinh. We took an amazing tour with the company next door as well. Lino and bonafacio made our stay very easy. This is the perfect place along the coast to relax in a beautiful space!
Paradise!
The loft is exactly as shown. The views are incredible and the pool is amazing. We also enjoyed the common terrace, from which you can see the beautiful stars. Having A/C in the room as well as a fan proved quite useful. We spent a couple of hours in the hot afternoon just reading overlooking the view and loved it.

The view was incredible. There were folks waiting for us on shore when we arrived by boat. The remote location was perfect for a restorative and romantic getaway! It rained for part of our stay, which made the walk into Chimo fairly difficult (a portion of the path is clay, and it was quite slippery and steep). The rain also seemed to coax out the bugs, from mosquitoes to incredibly large beetles and flies. We were very grateful for the bug net!
Los Chonchos is a magical place and we had such a wonderful time staying at Chuck & Yvonne's palapa. We arrived at the beach well prepared (thanks to Yvonne's thorough instructions) and were greeted warmly by members of the small community and other guests. Everyone we met was very helpful and friendly. The fridge in the palapa was broken while we were there, but Yvonne arranged for ice blocks to be brought in and the locals made sure we had as much as we needed. The trek to Chimo was challenging but entirely worth the effort for lunch, cold beer and fresh shrimp. Be sure to check out the playita (aka big beach) - and be prepared to feel as though you're the only people in the world. This was the perfect place to unwind, unplug and enjoy some of Mexico's most beautiful natural wonders. We'll be sure to stay longer when we come back.
Chuck and Yvonne were absolutely amazing to work with. They left nothing unanswered and were extremely timely in their responses to our questions! We had the pleasure of meeting them and they are as genuine and gracious as expected!
Our stay in Palapa Tranquila was unimaginably wonderful and greatly exceeded our expectations. The open air palapa paired with the expanse of Banderas Bay created feelings of calmness, peace, and a great sense of freedom. We found the palapa to be just as shown in the pictures, and as described by our hosts, Yvonne and Chuck. They were very helpful before our arrival, responding quickly to our questions and concerns (and we had many!). We would highly recommend Palapa Tranquila to anyone who is looking for a rejuvenating vacation experience, especially those with an adventurous spirit. Although we spent plenty of time reading, relaxing, and enjoying the wildlife, we took advantage of all there is to do and see in the local area. Along with snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, and playing in the waves, we made several excursions on foot to the village of Chimo where we ate ceviche at Arturo's restaurant and bought fresh produce. We took the water taxi to the village of Yelapa for an afternoon, and went on an amazing tour of the Marieta Islands. We met so many wonderful people, and enjoyed breathtaking sunsets each and every night. To us, this was the experience of a lifetime. Thank you Chuck and Yvonne for allowing us to stay in your beautiful palapa home. We dream of the day we can visit Los Chonchos again!
I can honestly say we had the most amazing time staying at Chuck and Yvonne's palapa. Los Chonchos is a hidden gem and we will absolutely be back. Henry was so helpful and knowledgable and took such great care of us with whatever we needed. It was such a memorable experience. We made full use of the snorkelling equipment and the many kayaks available. Our neighbours were friendly and respectful and we had so much privacy.
The palapa was ready upon our arrival. Henry met us on the beach and showed us the ropes. After poking around a bit, we had everything needed for a wonderfully relaxed stay.
By far one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and special places I have traveled. Not only on airbnb, but in all my traveling adventures. This is the way to see Mexico and I highly recommend this great spot! Yvonne and Chuck were a breeze to communicate with and responded quickly to any questions I had. I also found it helpful to read other reviews and their house manual as it has EVERYTHING you need to know for preparing your trip. Here is a mini example of our trip: You will most likely spend a night in PV on your way in or out due to flight times and the water taxi schedule to the palapa. Our flight was delayed out of JFK so we missed our connecting flight in Mexico City, thus delaying us several hours to PV. No problem! We hung out in D.F. for the day getting into PV in the evening. We found two rooms at Hotel Yasmin (a decent no frills spot) and hit up the grocery store stocking up on beer, grains, tequila, toilet paper and snacks. All four of us packed lightly (not hard when all you plan on wearing is your swim suit and shorts for a week) so we could fit all of our extra stuff in our luggage backpacks or duffle bags. We grabbed a cab the next morning around 0730 for 200 pesos to Boca. We bought dairy and veggies at the little market near where you pick up the water taxi and then took the 0900 Nyali to Los Chonchos. Upon arrival we were greeted by a sweet, sweet man named Henry who helped us get settled and gave us the run down of the palapa and surrounding area. We had a delicious lunch that Alfonso prepared for us at the palapa restaurant and then we took a little hike to Chimo and bought more veggies and fresh seafood from Anotonio (who owns the restaurant, Chimo's). If you want a fresh coconut you can buy one for 15 pesos from the dude chillin in the hammock in front of the mansion (the only structure) on the swimming beach that is about a 15 minute walk from the palapa. We spent the next six days in maximum relaxation mode making incredible meals, reading, sunbathing, snorkeling and day dreaming. Once we were out of fish we went back to Chimo to buy some more and had ceviche at Arturo's restaurant -it was delicious!!! We slept to the sound of the waves right beneath us and woke up to whales playing right outside the palapa (NO JOKE!!). Our trip was pretty much like living in a Mexican fairy tale. Have fun!

If you are looking for something different, an adventurous vacation away from it all, with tranquil days in the sun, deserted beaches and evenings of watching beautiful sunsets, you have found your paradise. Your adventure will be an unforgettable escape from the modern every day rat race. 
The palapa house, La Palapa Tranquila, is in an eco resort called Chonchos. It is very remote, which means on some occasions you will need to spend your first night in the beautiful city of Puerto Vallarta. There you can enjoy your first evening dining in one of the finest restaurants, visiting many of the art galleries, or strolling along the malecon. We can recommend a hotel in PV if you like. If time allows after the arrival of your flight into PV, you can go directly to the palapa and catch the 3:00 PM water taxi Nayeli, from Boca de Tomatlan, an hour from PVR airport. 
The water taxi ride will take you by the scenic coastline where the green lush mountains meet the deep blue Pacific Ocean with small Mexican fishing villages, the well known town of Yelapa and other small vacation resorts along the way. After the hour water taxi ride you will arrive at the beach of Chonchos and be greeted by the staff who will help take your luggage to La Palapa Tranquila. The palapa house is off the grid with solar panels to give you the modern convenience of refrigeration and lights. We have a solar hot water heater for nice warm showers and drinkable clean spring water. Most personal cell phones will have service at the palapa if one wishes to use one. Instead of watching TV  you will be entertained by nature with a variety of animals, birds and insects and an wide ocean view right in front of the palapa where sightings of whales, dolphins, manta rays and other fish are an entertaining every day phenomena depending what time of the year you are visiting.
There are beautiful hikes, one of which takes you to the next quaint little village, Chimo, where one can get cold beer, basic groceries and dine at one of the two local restaurants. Some other activities include kayaking, snorkeling, birding and fishing. You can also take  day trips to other small villages such as Yelapa and Pizota by water taxi. If you are looking for a different type of vacation then look no more!
Freshly cooked meals at our small restaurant overlooking the beach!
Restaurante de Chonchos
The cost is $110.00 per couple, or 1500 pesos, for 2-3 meals a day. The cost does not include tips.
If you have phone service, you may contact us at any time! Ruben, Gabriel and Alphonso work at Chonchos and are more than happy to assist you with any problems you may encounter.
The neighborhood is unique, because there are no roads, so it is very quiet and peaceful. No cars, so all transportation is by foot, mule, kayak or boat.
There is a water taxi, Nayeli, which goes by twice a day to pick up and drop off passengers at our beach. The cost is approximately 130 pesos each way per person from Boca to Chonchos. Departure times: 
9:00 AM and 3:00 PM from Boca to our place
11:00 AM and 5:00 PM back to Boca
Check in is after 3:00 PM unless the place can be ready for you earlier. Please contact me regarding earlier check in!
The water taxi can also take you to Yelapa, Pizota and Chimo for the day.

It was perfect for our vacation in every sense. Ana has clearly paid close attention to detail in making this tree house experience be authentic and comfortable at the same time. Also we loved getting to know Ana and Tim and wish we could have spent more time with them. We definitely plan on coming back to visit Ana's slice of heaven!
El lugar es rústico pero con todas las comodidades. Ana es muy atenta, fué por mi a la estación de autobús y con el hospedaje incluye el desayuno. Las instalaciones estaban muy limpias considerando el trabajo que implica por estar en medio de arboles. El lugar esta a unos 20 min. caminando de la playa, el camino es de tierra y parece más lejos de lo que en realidad es. Por la noche es oscuro y solitario, así es que conviene llevar lámpara para ver por donde pisar, pero el sitio es seguro. Al llegar a la propiedad lo que se obtiene por la caminata es un lugar desde el que se pueden ver las estrellas, el sitio invita a desconectarse de la locura del mundo, invita a dejarse llevar por los sonidos del río, de los insectos, se pueden apreciar aves que llegan a los árboles y sobre todo invita a relajarse.
This place is amazing. Beautiful, quiet, unique. After staying here I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Sayulita. Ana is incredibly nice and very helpful. It's more of a walk to the beach than some other places, but it's absolutely worth it, and if you want you can rent a golf cart to get back and forth. Loved it.
We had an unforgettable experience at Ana's jungle treehouse. Ana kindly picked us up from Sayulita bus station, and a short drive later, we were given a tour of our jungle home. We were impressed by the amenities and were instantly made to feel at home by our lovely host. It was incredibly peaceful during the day and the night. Ana lives nearby if we needed her, although we the treehouse itself affords a lot of privacy. We were brought breakfast each morning, which was a nice bonus. The beach is a 15-minute walk away along a safe road. We would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend highly enough!
Sarah and I loved our stay in Ana's magical treehouse. Truly an unforgettable experience. It was our first time in Sayulita, and Ana was so welcoming and helpful. She made sure we were comfortable our whole trip, offered suggestions, had breakfast ready every morning, and was overall a lovely presence to be around. We also enjoyed renting her neighbor's golf cart, which made exploring Sayulita even easier :)
This was a beautiful and tranquil escape. The treehouse is on the edge of the jungle with a couple of other properties in a large fenced area. Constructed by Ana the tree house has a double bed complete with mosquito net and sitting area (we did yoga here) upstairs with great views. Downstairs there's a fully equip kitchen and bathroom and there is electricity, hot water and wifi. The tree house is a 10-15minute walk from the village which is easy but Ana is also thinking of getting some bikes. Ana was an extremely welcoming host, nothing was too much trouble, breakfast was provided (very nice) and she even gave us a lift to the bus station and thought of a short cut (which she communicated to the driver) to make our journey easier. Would highly recommend!

Guests will have access to the entirety of the treehouse/palapa: the bedroom, the deck, the shower and bathroom downstairs, and the reading area and kitchen. They will also have access to a refrigerator close by.
I am happy to interact and help my guests with advice and recommendations for Sayulita; however, if you prefer to be by yourselves and have complete privacy, I am able to accomodate that as well.
I love the peace and tranquility on my property, the trees, flowers, and jungle out here, the abundant shade, the butterflies, and cool, relaxing pace of life.
I am approximately 2 km from town. You can get to my place by walking in a great green way, taking a taxi, or with a rental car.

The sleeping quarters are indoors and air conditioned when desired.
Although we know exceptions exist, we believe that our home is not well suited to first time travelers to Isla Mujeres, babies/toddlers, or high maintenance vacationers. 
Please remember this is our home, not a hotel. You can expect to find spiders and mismatched linens. We look forward to hosting you as our guest!
Guests will have access to the entire home and property during their stay. We have a large lap pool that is good for exercise or relaxing.
During almost all bookings I will be available on the island should the guests  need or want anything. I will always be available via email or phone. In the event that I am off the island, I will make arrangements for a care taker to check guests in and out of the property. I am more than happy to offer my suggestions on local actives and restaurants.
The south point neighborhood is unique for a variety of reasons. Our neighborhood is much quieter than other locations on the island. If you're looking to get away from it all, this is the spot for you! Some of the most beautiful views on the island are located on the south point. There are some wonderful hiking/jogging trails on the cliffs on the caribbean right in front of the house. During the early morning and evening, lots of locals can be found exercising on the sidewalks and streets of the neighborhood. Also on the south point is a sculpture garden and Mayan Ruins. You might be interested to note that the south point is the easternmost point in Mexico and is the first place to see the sunrise daily. It is a very popular spot on New Year's Eve as revelers enjoy greeting the New Year at the first light of dawn.
Getting around the south point is very easy by foot. Getting to Casa de Musica from downtown requires a taxi or golf cart. We are located approximately 1 mile from the La Gloria neighborhood that houses a mid sized grocery store with liquor. Downtown amenities and the ferry that crosses to the mainland are about 4 miles from the house. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the Casa but most of the main bars, restaurants, shops, and stores are located mid island or downtown. The Isla Delivery Service charges a minimal fee (50 pesos + tip) to deliver food and booze from many local establishments.
It is important to note that although taxis do pass by the house regularly they are not as frequent as downtown and are slightly more expensive. Travelers staying here should budget for transportation unless they enjoy walking or biking for transport. Parking is available for rental cars and golf carts.
The ferries from Cancun do not run 24 hours a day so do your best to get flights that don't arrive/depart too early or late. No earlier than 9:30 am departure or 8:30pm arrival, is my recommendation.",Indoor-Outdoor South Point Casa - Houses for Rent in Isla Mujeres,12:00 PM (noon),7732802,-86.71600311670082

It is in a lovely, and very convenient location within easy walking distance to beach, shops and 5th Avenue. I especially enjoyed the view of the trees and ocean from the balcony. The apartment is not as big as depicted in the pictures, and it is in need of a little tlc. I had an issue with the toilet seat being broken, but Ben got this fixed quickly. It is in a nice, quiet area except for some noisy neighborhood dogs, which really didn't bother me too much. I do prefer a darker room for sleeping but some well placed towels really helped. The stairs up are quite steep and I don't think this would be a great place for elderly or young kids. The pool looked nice, but we didn't use it with the beach so close by. Overall, it was a adequately equipped and with a little work will be a great place to stay.
Wonderful location , walking distance to everything you need . Comfortable and cozy perfect place to relax !
Ben is awesome! Very helpful and always responds right away! His place was in a great location.
We had an excelent stay at Benoits apartment! It was very clean and well equipped with all the things we needed, as described in the information text. The apartment is very close to the beach and the 5th avenue, so we didn't need to take a taxi except the arrival/departure. Even if we had rainy days we enjoyed our stay and we can recommend staying at Benoits apartment!
We had fresh fruit and Coronas waiting for us! The pictures were exactly what we were expecting, and there was also additional seating on the balcony. The location was perfect for us too. It was close enough to walk or taxi to anywhere we wanted to go, but not in the middle of all the touristy stuff. The bed was also super comfy, especially after a long day.

The stay was very pleasant. Javier was always very kind and helpful. The Cabanas is very good and the location close to the beach and the centre is perfect. Thanks a lot, Javier. We would come back at any time.
My friend Aimee & I stayed at Javier's Cabanas for 6 nights and loved it. Javier has put a lot of effort into his magical little corner of Mazunte and it shows. I particularly loved all of the plants, around the hammocks and all around the space. Birds of Paradise, ferns, ivy, banana trees. You feel very close to nature when staying there. For the price you pay it is excellent value. It has everything you need for the tropics - beds, mosquito nets, a cold shower, organic toiletries and hammocks. Cold beer & Mezcal are never far away. There is a lovely bakery at the top of the track selling coffee & freshly cooked pastries. His dog, Nipu (not sure how to spell her name - sorry Nipu!), is lovely. Javier is a sweetheart. Happy to recommend to other travellers.
This place was beautiful and Javier was a great host! He really looks after the place and the cabana we stayed in was so comfortable.. even natural toiletries included! The location is also great and there are many cheap places to eat close by. You fel like you are in a quiet jungle here.. so peaceful!

The Cabanas are off one of the main small streets leading to the beach, but far enough back to feel private and the setting is nicely landscaped. The Cabanas are a nice place to stay and the price is very reasonable.
Pasamos unos días muy tranquilos en la escondida. Todo estaba a nuestro gusto. We loved the hammocks. Javier is a great host. He has the whole place is very well kept and clean.

She gave written english and spanish directions, and her home was exactly as presented in her listing.
We had a great stay with Franny and really enjoyed her house, as well as the town. I cannot emphasise enough how nice the house is, truly something that needs to be experienced in person! Franny also helped us orient ourselves in St. Miguel and every morning we had a fresh pot of coffee ready!
Franny es una excelente anfitrión, muy hospitalaria, la habitación estuvo muy cómoda y limpia. La casa WOW!!! las 500 palabras no alcanzan para describirla, literalmente no tomamos fotos en cada rincón de ella. Estamos muy agradecidos de haber sido aceptados por Franny como sus huéspedes. Definitivamente vamos a regresar :) En el viaje nos acompaño mi hijo pequeño, Franny hizo una pequeña cama con almohadas, Emiliano estaba fascinado con su camita mini mini. De nuevo gracias Franny :D
La estancia con Franny fue corta pero muy agradable! Estuvo muy atenta a nuestra llegada y nos dio tips muy buenos para conocer San Miguel. Fue mi primera experiencia en Airb&b y sin duda recomendaría a Franny para tu visita en San Miguel.
Desde que hice mi reservación me di cuenta de lo atenta que es Franny, lo que me hizo sentir cómodo y en confianza desde el primer momento. Al llegar al lugar nos dimos cuenta que era mucho mejor de lo que habíamos pensado, ver la casa en persona te sorprende y la amabilidad de Franny te hace sentir en casa. Nos quedamos con ganas de convivir más con ella porque te das cuenta de que es una persona muy interesante pero el tiempo no fue suficiente. El lugar es tan mágico como el pueblo ya que se vuelve parte de la experiencia de visitar San Miguel, porque es bonito, interesante, acogedor, impecable, etc. Además de que puedes salir a caminar, ver muchas cosas y llegar al centro sin mucho problema.
Franny's Rose Cottage is really a fantasy house. In fact, it's the most beautiful house I have ever seen. The design is unique, with her favorite Gaudi style, and you would never find such a place in any hotels. Really love it. The location is quite convenient as well, just 15 minute walk to the cathedral and most other attractions. Franny was very nice to give me suggestions for local restaurants and boutique shops. Her recommendations are great. Really enjoyed the stay at Franny's house and hope to stay longer next time. For anyone who would like to have some unique experience in San Miguel de Allende, this is the place you should not miss. Highly recommended!
If you have ever wanted to experience what it's like to live inside of a fairytale, please consider this place. Franny's place, while not being the closest location in San Miguel , it definitely has the best one. The place is filled with details, from a sea of books everywhere in the house, to iron roses tangled in every corner. If you ever visited Barcelona, you might relate this place with the work of Gaudí. As for Franny, I would definitely consider her a top tier host. At the time of my visit, she had her ankle broken and was using an apparatus to be able to walk, and that didn't stop her from trying to give us the best experiences and commodities. If you're into writing or fantasy in general, be prepared for some very nice and deep conversations.

At one end are two private rooms, each with a queen-sized bed, and a shared bathroom (there is purified, filtered water throughout the house).   This listing is for the “Flower Room,"" which has botanical paintings set into the wardrobe doors.  At the other end is a lovely sun-drenched study, perfect for painters and writers, where coffee will be available in the mornings. Enjoy the abundant light and trees; the luxuriant gardens; the patio; the terrace, with its expansive view; and the romantic and tranquil interior.
I'll give you a key to the first floor (which is where I live) should you want to use the kitchen, laundry and ironing facilities, or meet any of my four friendly dogs.  I'm often around during the day and will be happy to give you whatever information I can to help you best enjoy your experience in San Miguel.
Rose Cottage is in the neighborhood of Allende, which is an easy walk to the Organic Market and the Instituto Allende, and about a fifteen-minute walk to the Jardin (the town square), as well as being close to buses and cabs.  You will have a completely different “home"" experience in Allende than in Centro.  Allende is a traditional Mexican neighborhood, brimming with small family-owned enterprises—fruit-and-vegetable markets, grocery stores, and many delightful food stands and restaurants.  The neighborhood children play on the street outside Rose Cottage: I first got to know them when, after returning a ball they'd kicked over my wall, they brought me a butterfly to set loose in my garden.  They are lovely kids! Allende is as safe as any neighborhood in San Miguel—the neighbors all watch out for each other—and wonderfully friendly and warm.

Tuvimos una estancia muy agradable con Mauricio y la descripcion de la habitacion es bastante acertada. La vista al mar es increible y nos encanto despertar todas las mananas con el sonido de las olas. Definitivamente lo recomendamos como punto de partida, para explorar el Valle de Guadalupe
Our stay at Mauricio's could not have been more perfect. Our housing experience and our weekend in Ensenada exceeded our expectations and were simply wonderful. We were so grateful for Mauricio's help finding the best local foods and touring the nearby wineries. Highly recommend!
This was an absolutely wonderful place to stay. Mauricio has a wonderful house feet from the Pacific Ocean. It really is a relaxing piece of paradise. It's best to use a hotel/university as a point of reference for cab drivers. Coming from Alaska, we had no problem getting out and walking to explore the area. Two hotels nearby for meal options (Punto Morro has a delicious breakfast) and not too much further there is a grocery store. We didn't want to stay downtown (too much Baja 1000) chaos, but it was really easy to get downtown (taxi/bus/walk) and really easy to get cabs back (cheap too). Mauricio was absolutely wonderful. He and my husband had so much in common - it was a perfect fit. He made sure we had everything we needed.
Mauricio and Abby were amazing hosts this was an amazing experience. My boyfriend came for a great get away and the pleasure of meeting Mauricio and Abby and staying at an ocean front place. The views, sounds and accommodations are more than words can describe. I would highly recommend this diamond in the rough. Thanks to amazing hosts who made the experience.
The simplicity of Mauricio's home is offset by the breathtaking beauty of the ocean just steps away from the front door. Falling asleep and waking up to the sounds of the waves crashing on the shore is beyond beautiful. Mauricio's home is clean and welcoming. The bed is comfortable and the host is warm and kind. I enjoyed staring at the beautiful view for at least an hour each day. We will definitely return. Five stars!
Mauricio was an incredible host. He directed us to the best places: la guerrerense, the ""Black Market"" fish market, and more. Even more importantly, he connected us with the right people throughout Baja (the pluses of a host who works in the wine/restaurant biz). Waking up to crashing waves every morning is a dream, though if you're a lighter sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. Mauricio's dog, Vini, is super chill. Those who like more planning should take advantage of Mauricio's private, guided tours of the Valle wine region, or points of interest further south. Thank you for everything, Mauricio!

This is a 2 bedroom house with individual full bathrooms, separated each other by the living room where the kitchen, the chimmeney and a little lunch bar. The only and main door leads to the terrace right next to the Pacific Ocean. On the back of the house there is a big indoor patio with another 1/2 bathroom, and plenty of space for big items, (where I keep my Kayaks and other toys), and finally there is a big Office with desks, Wifi, phone, printer, copier and other office equipment.
My name is Mauricio Parra A.  I've been working in the tourism, food and wine business for almost a decade, I don't really know my occupation is but know I'm passionate about meeting people, food, wine, craft beer, and other guilty pleasures.
I consider myself a badass host and pretty much let my guests do whatever they want and make themselves feel at home. 
If you like your privacy, I could just introduce myself, give you the keys and leave, but that's not what usually happens. What usually happens is that we start the day with freshly brewed coffee, go on a little kayak trip and have a proper breakfast afterwards, with some more coffee. Then, we could go and eat to some of the best street food places in town, or at one of the many fine dining restaurants in the city and the Valle De Guadalupe. You name it...

There's a vast array of things to do at your fingertips. We're in the middle of the action, the house is only 5 minutes away from the city center and 25 minutes away from Valle De Guadalupe, where 80+ wineries and restaurants are waiting for you.
The main reference is Punta Morro Resort, you could walk across the beach from the house terrace to the restaurant and be there in two minutes. 
There's plenty of parking space and if you don't have a car, taxis are the best option and won't charge you that much.
If you're interested, I can arrange different activities for you or get you tickets to gigs and all sort of events.
One of my jobs is to organize tours, from uncommon winery tours, bar-hoping and incredible street food, to produce farms and some incredible eco-tourism sites.

She was on her way to freshen up my room when I arrived. Michelle is a very energetic person and appears enthusiastic about what she does. It's always a better experience for me when I get to work with people who love what they do. I only spoke with her upon my arrival, but that's only because I didn't have any issues. The room was as described, and pretty much exactly what I was expecting. I rented this room specifically for the private rooftop terrace, and I wasn't disappointed. The view is incredible. There was a lot of construction going on, including in Michelle's room adjoined to this one. This is the low season however, so I would anticipate this and see that it is reflected in the low seasonal price. WIFI works just fine. Everything was quiet at night. I even took some private walks on the beach at night. Sometimes I didn't see a single other person. The beach was only lightly populated during the day. Very peaceful and relaxing this time of year. Without a doubt I would stay here again.
Todo ok, muy buena atención.
magnifico apartamento a un buen precio, vistas espectaculares y gran ubicación, muy fácil moverse desde aquí a cualquier zona de Cancún sin coche. Michelle muy atenta con nosotros y dispuesta a resolver cualquier duda. Una buena elección.
Michelle's place is fantastic and I would highly recommend it. We ended up showing up earlier than she expected but she was a perfect host and our place was all ready to go. It was a great location and exactly what we expected. Michelle provided us with plenty of information on getting the best out of Cancun and we had a fabulous time. The private use of the rooftop deck is the true stand out of this place and we used it quite often and it's an absolutely stunning view of the area. I highly recommend staying here and letting Michelle be your host. It was a true pleasure! Thanks Michelle! Jason Lanham
In general, the room was clean and Michelle was a very helpful and considerate host. However, we did have a couple issues that we feel important to mention: 1) Don't count on the internet - It took 2 days and Michelle giving us 3 different modems to get a reliable signal so we advise not depending on the internet while you're there. 2) Although the room is nice and clean, the building (Solymar) is very rundown - there's rust everywhere and the pool is in pretty bad shape, the tiles need to be replaced so badly that I got a huge cut from the bottom of the pool. All that said, we had a lovely time in Cancun while outside of the building - buses were amazing and plenty of things to do!
The place was great, we were greeted with enthusiasm and patience from Michelle after our delayed arrival from the airport to the room. She explained everything very clearly and had some great recommendations for dining during our stay. The location is convenient and within a stones throw from the beach. We enjoyed lounging at the pool early in the day and heading down a few stairs towards the beach in the afternoon. The bar and grill on the beach is pretty terrible (which Michelle warned us about) but also very convenient if you are really hungry. For the price, accommodations, and 2 private balconys with AMAZING views, I assure you that there isn't a better deal in Cancun. Thanks for a great stay!
Michelle's place was great. It is further south than many of the big name hotels which makes it much quieter and nicer in my opinion. She provided beach towels, umbrella, and chairs. The views are great as well. There is a convenience store less than half a mile away that is walkable (turn left out of the condo). I highly recommend her place and I'll return here on my next visit. A bus ride to anywhere is a short 5 to 25 minutes costing less than a USD. Cancun is easy to navigate. A taxi to the airport was 300 pesos and you might be able to get it for 250. Isla Mujeres was phenomenal and highly recommend. A round trip ticket from the ferry is $19. A golf cart on the island is $35-40. Thanks Michelle for all of your assistance during our stay!

The room was as described, and pretty much exactly what I was expecting. I rented this room specifically for the private rooftop terrace, and I wasn't disappointed. The view is incredible. There was a lot of construction going on, including in Michelle's room adjoined to this one. This is the low season however, so I would anticipate this and see that it is reflected in the low seasonal price. WIFI works just fine. Everything was quiet at night. I even took some private walks on the beach at night. Sometimes I didn't see a single other person. The beach was only lightly populated during the day. Very peaceful and relaxing this time of year. Without a doubt I would stay here again.
Todo ok, muy buena atención.
magnifico apartamento a un buen precio, vistas espectaculares y gran ubicación, muy fácil moverse desde aquí a cualquier zona de Cancún sin coche. Michelle muy atenta con nosotros y dispuesta a resolver cualquier duda. Una buena elección.
Michelle's place is fantastic and I would highly recommend it. We ended up showing up earlier than she expected but she was a perfect host and our place was all ready to go. It was a great location and exactly what we expected. Michelle provided us with plenty of information on getting the best out of Cancun and we had a fabulous time. The private use of the rooftop deck is the true stand out of this place and we used it quite often and it's an absolutely stunning view of the area. I highly recommend staying here and letting Michelle be your host. It was a true pleasure! Thanks Michelle! Jason Lanham
In general, the room was clean and Michelle was a very helpful and considerate host. However, we did have a couple issues that we feel important to mention: 1) Don't count on the internet - It took 2 days and Michelle giving us 3 different modems to get a reliable signal so we advise not depending on the internet while you're there. 2) Although the room is nice and clean, the building (Solymar) is very rundown - there's rust everywhere and the pool is in pretty bad shape, the tiles need to be replaced so badly that I got a huge cut from the bottom of the pool. All that said, we had a lovely time in Cancun while outside of the building - buses were amazing and plenty of things to do!
The place was great, we were greeted with enthusiasm and patience from Michelle after our delayed arrival from the airport to the room. She explained everything very clearly and had some great recommendations for dining during our stay. The location is convenient and within a stones throw from the beach. We enjoyed lounging at the pool early in the day and heading down a few stairs towards the beach in the afternoon. The bar and grill on the beach is pretty terrible (which Michelle warned us about) but also very convenient if you are really hungry. For the price, accommodations, and 2 private balconys with AMAZING views, I assure you that there isn't a better deal in Cancun. Thanks for a great stay!
Michelle's place was great. It is further south than many of the big name hotels which makes it much quieter and nicer in my opinion. She provided beach towels, umbrella, and chairs. The views are great as well. There is a convenience store less than half a mile away that is walkable (turn left out of the condo). I highly recommend her place and I'll return here on my next visit. A bus ride to anywhere is a short 5 to 25 minutes costing less than a USD. Cancun is easy to navigate. A taxi to the airport was 300 pesos and you might be able to get it for 250. Isla Mujeres was phenomenal and highly recommend. A round trip ticket from the ferry is $19. A golf cart on the island is $35-40. Thanks Michelle for all of your assistance during our stay!

We had a wonderful time at Akumal. The unit is just steps to the beach and is clean and well kept. The snorkeling was the best. We saw corrals as big as houses at the mouth of the bay. Water is clear due to the reef blocking incoming waves. Once you swim past the seaweeds, we saw all sorts of fish and inverter rates under the rocks. The beach is beautiful, white sand beaches. We saw iguanas everywhere. It is an amazing place to visit.
Excellent instructions for checking in and everyone there was very helpful. Very comfortable apartment and fabulous location. I can really recommend this for a stay at a lovely beach with a very chilled ambience. Good diving and snorkelling. Great local restaurant too!
The condo is situated in the heart of Akumal, were snorkeling, sea turtle sightings, scuba diving are just a walk away. There are also some amazing restaurants with beautiful view; we were able to eat our dinner out on the back patio and watch the sunset. The condo staff was pleasant and very attentive to our needs, she Berenice herself is very responsive if you have any questions in planning your trip and also throughout the stay. I highly recommend this spot is you are looking for a quieter and more restful stay and also be near Tulum (about a 30 min drive away). We will definitely consider this spot on our next visit!
The management team that showed us in is amazing! Welcoming and helpful. The beach is the perfect location. Palapas and chairs always available. We just swam out from our place into the ocean and saw a sea turtle, stingray and a school of about 500 large fish! The other fish looked like they came from an aquarium, colorful and plentiful. I wish I brought an insect spray with deet for my legs. I got bit from the little things in the sand. Great restaurants super close. Cute little space but be sure to bring nightshades for your eyes if you have trouble sleeping. The lights outside shine in through the skylight and glass tile windows. Tiny bathroom, not for a large person. Cooking area but needs basics like oil.
We had a great stay in Akumal here! The place was cozy and clean and we loved being only steps from the beach. Though we did see a fair amount of seaweed, I didn't think there was any smell other than ocean unlike a previous review. The staff there was very helpful and went to work immediately when we found that the A/C wasn't working our second day there. Though they weren't able to get it fixed that afternoon, the allowed us to use the unit next door instead which was great. Nice location, the convenience store right there was great for quick snacks.
Our stay at Berenice's place was great. It is steps from the beach and management and housekeeping was excellent. Restaurants close by are wonderful as well as the locals. We only had one issue but it was quickly resolved by the maintenance crew. I have nothing but good things to say about our stay there.

Half Moon Bay is a very magical, relaxing and fantastic place that will let you experience one of the most amazing gifts from nature, which is to be able to see the nesting of female turtles and the hatching of their babies. You can see a turtle lay her eggs and bury them, and on the same night you can see baby turtles emerging from a nest right in front of you… a once in a lifetime experience!! And all these can be witnessed just a few steps from my condo.
Casita NORTE has a great central location, within walking distance you can find Akumal's Yal-Ku Lagoon... simply put a heaven for snorkeling! You can see turtles, parrot fishes, rays, and fascinating marine life. A unique place where the clear and salty water of the Caribbean Ocean meets with the fresh water of the Lagoon Yal-ku.

The room--we stayed in the Mexican suite--was such a gem, clean and well-kept. It had all the amenities we needed, from TP to Towels, pots and pans to olive oil and coffee. Cathy brought us up fresh baked, warm cookies (we thought would last a week but lasted two days because they were so delicious). The porch off the room had a view of the water, and you could even see it while showering. The upper roof deck had plenty of seating, room and views of the beach and ocean, with amazing sunsets.

Cathy's Mexican suite was our Mexican dream, from the word go she made us feel very welcomed with complementary cheese platter and freshly baked cookies which is just what we needed. Her suites are all decked out with all you need. Relaxing view points from out our balcony the bbq area and landing before the beach which was our favourite watching Mexican sunsets. Cathy is very knowledgeable about the area made us feel safe and pointed us in the detection of the Baja wine country where we had a blast tasting the regions best wines. Nothing was to much trouble. Her pet dogs are sweet and so well trained, and her garden I'm envious off :) thanks for our wonderful stay
Cathy is a gracious and kind host.
This is a gem! Cathy is incredibly kind and made us feel so welcome right from the first moments we arrived. To open our door and find cookies still warm from the oven was our first hint that this was a very special place. Our suite was beautiful and with every convenience we could have wanted. Add to that a private ocean view and the most comfortable bed, and we have a recipe for a perfect relaxing getaway. Cathy went over the top to accommodate us, even providing excellent driving instructions there and back again. We can't wait to go back and bring our dog with us!
Not only was this place beautiful, cozy, and full of amenities, it possibly the most relaxed I have ever been in my life. Cathy was a wealth of information from making sure we had good directions. to the best places to eat, and all importantly, when was the best time of day to re-cross the border (it takes a long time). We were welcomed with a beautiful clean condo, fresh baked cookies and the smell of the ocean. The beach is nearly private and so peaceful. My husband and I stayed here for three nights and only left because we're average people who have to get back to work at some point. :) I would recommend this spot to anyone: couples, families. etc. We're hoping to come back with our friends and rent out all three units in the future.
Don't know how our stay could have been any better. We were greeted warmly by Cathy who is as cheery as she looks in her picture. The online photos of the apartment - as great as they are - don't do it justice. Every corner reflects Cathy's artistic touch, creating an wonderfully embracing space. The complementary cheese plate didn't hurt our first impression, either. It took us all of 10 seconds to wish we had time for a longer stay. We slept well, used both balconies, and our dog loved the beach as much as we did.
Our host Cathy was amazing! Even before we arrived, her communication was superb. She sent us a detailed list of things to do and special places to go. She got the Mexican car insurance for me, so I didn't have to worry about a thing!! We arrived early, so our room wasn't quite ready. She immediately came out to greet us and suggested a wonderful local restaurant for lunch, Poco Cielo, that we could walk to. Oscar, our waiter, was exceptional along with the food. When we came back to check in, Cathy had made homemade chocolate chip cookies and had a delicious plate of cheeses and grapes for us waiting in our room. Cathy upgraded us to the Asian suite which was beautiful. Living space, full kitchen, amazing wood ceiling bedroom and the best part was we had access to the upstairs deck to enjoy the gorgeous views of the ocean. We ventured up the coast to the small fishing village of Popotla, where we bought a fresh fish right off the boat. We had it filleted for us and brought it home to cook on the grill that was on the upstairs deck!! The area was quiet and peaceful. The sounds of the waves crashing during the night lulled us to sleep. We can't wait to return to Cathy's oasis!!!
We had a wonderful stay at Cathy's AirBnB. The room--we stayed in the Mexican suite--was such a gem, clean and well-kept. It had all the amenities we needed, from TP to Towels, pots and pans to olive oil and coffee. Cathy brought us up fresh baked, warm cookies (we thought would last a week but lasted two days because they were so delicious). The porch off the room had a view of the water, and you could even see it while showering. The upper roof deck had plenty of seating, room and views of the beach and ocean, with amazing sunsets.

I wish I had more time to check out all the places he recommended! The views of the sunset from his waterfront home are epic. There's great breakfast at the Punta Morro restaurant 100 meters down the beach. It's a long walk to Ensenada downtown Ensenada (took me about an hour), but taxis are 50-70 pesos, uber about half that. There is also a bus stop close by. Super secure parking for motorcycles provided they fit through the door. Enjoyed my stay & can't wait to go back!
Tuvimos una estancia muy agradable con Mauricio y la descripcion de la habitacion es bastante acertada. La vista al mar es increible y nos encanto despertar todas las mananas con el sonido de las olas. Definitivamente lo recomendamos como punto de partida, para explorar el Valle de Guadalupe
Our stay at Mauricio's could not have been more perfect. Our housing experience and our weekend in Ensenada exceeded our expectations and were simply wonderful. We were so grateful for Mauricio's help finding the best local foods and touring the nearby wineries. Highly recommend!
This was an absolutely wonderful place to stay. Mauricio has a wonderful house feet from the Pacific Ocean. It really is a relaxing piece of paradise. It's best to use a hotel/university as a point of reference for cab drivers. Coming from Alaska, we had no problem getting out and walking to explore the area. Two hotels nearby for meal options (Punto Morro has a delicious breakfast) and not too much further there is a grocery store. We didn't want to stay downtown (too much Baja 1000) chaos, but it was really easy to get downtown (taxi/bus/walk) and really easy to get cabs back (cheap too). Mauricio was absolutely wonderful. He and my husband had so much in common - it was a perfect fit. He made sure we had everything we needed.
Mauricio and Abby were amazing hosts this was an amazing experience. My boyfriend came for a great get away and the pleasure of meeting Mauricio and Abby and staying at an ocean front place. The views, sounds and accommodations are more than words can describe. I would highly recommend this diamond in the rough. Thanks to amazing hosts who made the experience.
The simplicity of Mauricio's home is offset by the breathtaking beauty of the ocean just steps away from the front door. Falling asleep and waking up to the sounds of the waves crashing on the shore is beyond beautiful. Mauricio's home is clean and welcoming. The bed is comfortable and the host is warm and kind. I enjoyed staring at the beautiful view for at least an hour each day. We will definitely return. Five stars!
Mauricio was an incredible host. He directed us to the best places: la guerrerense, the ""Black Market"" fish market, and more. Even more importantly, he connected us with the right people throughout Baja (the pluses of a host who works in the wine/restaurant biz). Waking up to crashing waves every morning is a dream, though if you're a lighter sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. Mauricio's dog, Vini, is super chill. Those who like more planning should take advantage of Mauricio's private, guided tours of the Valle wine region, or points of interest further south. Thank you for everything, Mauricio!

Thank you for everything, Mauricio!","Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico",House,1,"This house is incredible  close to the ocean, our only neighboors are the pacific ocean as a front yard, and on the back (50yds.) a community of chefs, wine makers and cool working people.
This is a 2 bedroom house with individual full bathrooms, separated each other by the living room where the kitchen, the chimmeney and a little lunch bar. The only and main door leads to the terrace right next to the Pacific Ocean. On the back of the house there is a big indoor patio with another 1/2 bathroom, and plenty of space for big items, (where I keep my Kayaks and other toys), and finally there is a big Office with desks, Wifi, phone, printer, copier and other office equipment.
My name is Mauricio Parra A.  I've been working in the tourism, food and wine business for almost a decade, I don't really know my occupation is but know I'm passionate about meeting people, food, wine, craft beer, and other guilty pleasures.
I consider myself a badass host and pretty much let my guests do whatever they want and make themselves feel at home. 
If you like your privacy, I could just introduce myself, give you the keys and leave, but that's not what usually happens. What usually happens is that we start the day with freshly brewed coffee, go on a little kayak trip and have a proper breakfast afterwards, with some more coffee. Then, we could go and eat to some of the best street food places in town, or at one of the many fine dining restaurants in the city and the Valle De Guadalupe. You name it... 
Sometimes I may be out of town

There's a vast array of things to do at your fingertips. We're in the middle of the action, the house is only 5 minutes away from the city center and 25 minutes away from Valle De Guadalupe, where 80+ wineries and restaurants are waiting for you.
The main reference is Punta Morro Resort, you could walk across the beach from the house terrace to the restaurant and be there in two minutes. 
There's plenty of parking space and if you don't have a car, taxis are the best option and won't charge you that much.
If you're interested, I can arrange different activities for you or get you tickets to gigs and all sort of events.
One of my jobs is to organize tours, from uncommon winery tours, bar-hoping and incredible street food, to produce farms and some incredible eco-tourism sites.

She was on her way to freshen up my room when I arrived. Michelle is a very energetic person and appears enthusiastic about what she does. It's always a better experience for me when I get to work with people who love what they do. I only spoke with her upon my arrival, but that's only because I didn't have any issues. The room was as described, and pretty much exactly what I was expecting. I rented this room specifically for the private rooftop terrace, and I wasn't disappointed. The view is incredible. There was a lot of construction going on, including in Michelle's room adjoined to this one. This is the low season however, so I would anticipate this and see that it is reflected in the low seasonal price. WIFI works just fine. Everything was quiet at night. I even took some private walks on the beach at night. Sometimes I didn't see a single other person. The beach was only lightly populated during the day. Very peaceful and relaxing this time of year. Without a doubt I would stay here again.
Todo ok, muy buena atención.
magnifico apartamento a un buen precio, vistas espectaculares y gran ubicación, muy fácil moverse desde aquí a cualquier zona de Cancún sin coche. Michelle muy atenta con nosotros y dispuesta a resolver cualquier duda. Una buena elección.
Michelle's place is fantastic and I would highly recommend it. We ended up showing up earlier than she expected but she was a perfect host and our place was all ready to go. It was a great location and exactly what we expected. Michelle provided us with plenty of information on getting the best out of Cancun and we had a fabulous time. The private use of the rooftop deck is the true stand out of this place and we used it quite often and it's an absolutely stunning view of the area. I highly recommend staying here and letting Michelle be your host. It was a true pleasure! Thanks Michelle! Jason Lanham
In general, the room was clean and Michelle was a very helpful and considerate host. However, we did have a couple issues that we feel important to mention: 1) Don't count on the internet - It took 2 days and Michelle giving us 3 different modems to get a reliable signal so we advise not depending on the internet while you're there. 2) Although the room is nice and clean, the building (Solymar) is very rundown - there's rust everywhere and the pool is in pretty bad shape, the tiles need to be replaced so badly that I got a huge cut from the bottom of the pool. All that said, we had a lovely time in Cancun while outside of the building - buses were amazing and plenty of things to do!
The place was great, we were greeted with enthusiasm and patience from Michelle after our delayed arrival from the airport to the room. She explained everything very clearly and had some great recommendations for dining during our stay. The location is convenient and within a stones throw from the beach. We enjoyed lounging at the pool early in the day and heading down a few stairs towards the beach in the afternoon. The bar and grill on the beach is pretty terrible (which Michelle warned us about) but also very convenient if you are really hungry. For the price, accommodations, and 2 private balconys with AMAZING views, I assure you that there isn't a better deal in Cancun. Thanks for a great stay!
Michelle's place was great. It is further south than many of the big name hotels which makes it much quieter and nicer in my opinion. She provided beach towels, umbrella, and chairs. The views are great as well. There is a convenience store less than half a mile away that is walkable (turn left out of the condo). I highly recommend her place and I'll return here on my next visit. A bus ride to anywhere is a short 5 to 25 minutes costing less than a USD. Cancun is easy to navigate. A taxi to the airport was 300 pesos and you might be able to get it for 250. Isla Mujeres was phenomenal and highly recommend. A round trip ticket from the ferry is $19. A golf cart on the island is $35-40. Thanks Michelle for all of your assistance during our stay!

Muy pendiente a la llegada y las necesidades de nosotras las dias que nos quedamos.
Our host was very helpful in suggesting activities to fit our needs. We enjoyed complimentary waters, juice and fruit upon arrival and the apartment was super convenient to many good restaurants. The dedicated parking spot was perfect for us since we had rented a car.
Daniel and Alvaro were both nice and made us feel confortable. Daniel even went to pick us up as we got a bit lost on the way. The room was clean and spacious. The wifi signal in the room was weak so to use it we had to stay in the living room but for us it wasnt much of a problem as we were out all day. The location is also good, only 10 min walk to 5th ave. I would definately book to stay there again. Thanks Daniel!
Quedamos muy contentos con nuestro anfitrión Daniel !!! Muy atento, pendiente de todos los detalles que podriamos necesitar, con toda la disponibilidad y apertura a nuestras necesidades. Colaborador, amable y servicial. Gracias Daniel por todas las atenciones, recomendadisimo!!!! El barrio muy tranquilo y cercano a tiendas, restaurantes, 5 ta avenida
Daniel was out of town on business so he put us in touch with his roommate, Alvaro, prior to our arrival. Alvaro was very friendly and accommodating: he drove us to the market to get groceries, recommended restaurants in the area, and drove us to the bus station upon our departure. The apartment was as described and in a nice and quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the beach. We highly recommend staying there and would surely re-book the next time we return to Playa del Carmen.
Daniel no tuve el gusto de conocerte durante mi estancia sin embargo Álvaro fue un excelente anfitrión, nos dio un recorrido por el departamento, amplio, limpio, con todos los servicios y unas camas muy cómodas, la ubicación nos vino muy bien. Sin dudar volveríamos; 100% recomendable. :) Gracias!

We enjoyed our stay immensely and would stay there again in a heartbeat if we are near Ajijic again! Thanks Cathy!
me enamore desde que vi la cabaña en el anuncio y de verdad que quedé maravillada, fue más de lo que esperaba...está muy bien equipada y super comoda, no dudaría en rentarla de nuevo, ademas esta super bien ubicada a unas cuadras de la plaza y muchas opciones de restaurantes y tiendas de arte...Cathy es muy linda y de verdad te hace sentir como en casa.
The gypsy caravan is a perfect place to enjoy the charm of Ajijic, in a garden in the middle of town. Convenient, easy in and out, protected parking at night if you have a car. Has everything you need to prepare simple meals. Birds, plants, cats and Cathy -- very comfortable accommodations, charming and easy-going host, wealth of information to share from many years in town. Cathy is very responsive, quick to answer messages. We loved staying at the Caravan.
The Gypsy Caravan in Paradise was such a wonderful place to stay. Cathy made me feel welcomed and the place was so cute and cozy. I would have loved to just hang out and read all day, but I was in Ajijic for a wedding and had to events to attend. If you are ever planning a trip to Ajijic, try to rent this place. It was quiet, peaceful and Cathy is so kind. Thank you, Cathy - I will be back!
Had a great time at Cathy's place. Very cozy and comfortable. Right close to the central plaza. Transportation only a couple blocks away.
The space is lovely, the grounds are lovely, Cathy is lovely. My best airbnb stay ever!
